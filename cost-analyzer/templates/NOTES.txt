Please allow 5-10 minutes for Kubecost to gather metrics.

If you have configured cloud-integrations, it can take up to 48 hours for cost reconciliation to occur.

When using Durable storage (Enterprise Edition), please allow up to 4 hours for data to be collected and the UI to be healthy.

When pods are Ready, you can enable port-forwarding with the following command:

    kubectl port-forward --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} deployment/{{ template "cost-analyzer.fullname" . }} {{ $servicePort }}

Next, navigate to http://localhost:{{ $servicePort }} in a web browser.
